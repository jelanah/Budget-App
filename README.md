# Budget-App
Budgeting Web App using JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML5

## How the App Works
* In the app, you may insert your own income and expenses
* Select the _'+'_ for income and the _'-'_ for expenses
* The percentages next to the expenses show the percentage of that expense in comparison to the total of income
* Total income, total expenses and total remaining are shown at the top of the app.
